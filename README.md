A group project I'm doing for TAFE.
sprint-1 branch is the one I was managing, incorporating the code from the others.
sprint-2 was managed by Andrew (including code I wrote) in his repository.
sprint-3 is managed by Ivan (including code I wrote) in his repository, and I'll mirror it in mine in case it's the final version.
* The tag "stars-graph-demo-tag" is some code I wrote to show use of the database fields for showing star ratings, not for the final version as that page was in the middle of being rewritten
