# A web app for a movie rental place - a group project we are doing for TAFE.

* sprint-1 branch is the one I (Caspian) was managing, incorporating the code from the others.
* sprint-2 branch was managed by Andrew (including code I wrote) in his repository.
* sprint-3 branch is managed by Ivan (including code I wrote) in his repository, and I'll mirror it in mine in case it's the final version.
* The tag "stars-graph-demo-tag" is a version where I wrote some code during sprint 3 to show use of the database fields for showing star ratings, not for the final version as that page was in the middle of being rewritten. https://github.com/cjmaclean/MovieGroupProject/tree/stars-graph-demo-tag
