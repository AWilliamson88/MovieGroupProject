MySQL does not have built-in Boolean type. However, it uses TINYINT(1) instead. To make it more convenient, MySQL provides BOOLEAN or BOOL as the synonym of TINYINT(1).

In MySQL, zero is considered as false, and non-zero value is considered as true. To use Boolean literals, you use the constants TRUE and FALSE that evaluate to 1 and 0 respectively.
